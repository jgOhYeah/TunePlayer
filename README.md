# TunePlayer
An Arduino library to decode and play simple tunes.

Each note is stored as a 16 bit integer and the method of loading tunes and how each note is played is reconfigurable. The current anticipated method of tune playing revolves around a pwm square wave.

NOTE: This documentation is a work in progress. The code works (AFAIK).
Have a look at the examples and class diagram in extras to get started.
